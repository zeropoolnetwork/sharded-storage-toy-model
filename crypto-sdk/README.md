# Crypto SDK for Sharded Storage Toy Example

This library implements the cryptographic operations used by Sharded Storage Toy Example.

## Building

To build: `pnpm tsc`.

To test: `pnpm test`.

## Noir Bindings

The `src/noir_codegen/` directory contains bindings autogenerated from Noir code in `../circuits/`.
We currently store them in Git to avoid reproducibility issues.
To re-generate them, do the following:

1. Generate `../circuits/export/main.json` file with Noir circuit description.
   For that, run the appropriate Nargo command from `../circuits/` (usually `nargo export`).

2. Generate TypeScript bindings from `../circuits/export/main.json`:
     `pnpm noir-gen-circuits`.
